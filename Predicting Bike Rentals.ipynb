    "In this project we are going to predict the total number of communal bikes people rented in a given hour. For prediction we will use Machine Learning models, such as: Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest. We will use data from University of Porto (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). The data set contains 17380 rows. Relevant columns are described below:\n",
    "- **instant** - A unique sequential ID number for each row\n",
    "- **dteday** - The date of the rentals\n",
    "- **season** - The season in which the rentals occurred (1:springer, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)\n",
    "- **yr** - The year the rentals occurred (0: 2011, 1:2012)\n",
    "- **mnth** - The month the rentals occurred (1 to 12)\n",
    "- **hr** - The hour the rentals occurred (0 to 23)\n",
    "- **holiday** - Whether or not the day was a holiday\n",
    "- **weekday** - The day of the week\n",
    "- **workingday** - Whether or not the day was a working day (if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0)\n",
    "- **weathersit** - The weather (as a categorical variable):\n",
    "    - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy\n",
    "    - 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist\n",
    "    - 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds\n",
    "    - 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **temp** - The temperature, on a 0-1 scale\n",
    "- **atemp** - The adjusted temperature\n",
    "- **hum** - The humidity, on a 0-1 scale\n",
    "- **windspeed** - The wind speed, on a 0-1 scale\n",
    "- **casual** - The number of casual riders (people who hadn't previously signed up with the bike sharing program)\n",
    "- **registered** - The number of registered riders (people who had already signed up)\n",
    "- **cnt** - The total number of bike rentals (casual + registered)\n",
